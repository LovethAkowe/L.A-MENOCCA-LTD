RECOMMENDATION

SALESPERSON

I recommend that the salesperson that performed below average be sent for additional training, Nancy Freehafer should be awarded the sales person for the year, she can also be encouraged  to train other sales personnel and ensure their improvement. Jan Kotas should go for additional training for his low sales and a stern warning to work harder or appropriate measures would be taken.

TOP 5 PRODUCT CATEGORY

I recommend  that  the top 5 products such as beverages, sauces, jam preserves, dairy products  and dried fruits and nuts should be looked into and ensure it doesn't get depleted.

TOP 10 CUSTOMERS

I recommend that the top company , company D be given the customer of the year award, and that all products bought by company D and the top 10 companies should always be in stock and depleted. For the months company D had low sales, it should be looked into if it is as a result of shortage in products so that products can be made available.

SALES BY REGION

I recommend that the  measures  enacted in the  north  to ensure great sales be enacted in the west with low sales and that the salesperson in the north - Nancy Freehafer - should be taken to the west to ensure that the measures  are properly enacted in the coming year.

SALES TREND REPORT

The measures taken in the month of December to ensure great sales  should be enacted for the month with low sales.

CONCLUSION

In summary, this analysis provides a clear and actionable overview of the sales landscape. Key performers, regions, and products are easily identified, aiding strategic focus. Nancy Freehafer and Company D are standout contributors to overall success. Seasonal or monthly fluctuations in revenue hint at opportunities for targeted marketing. The North region and New York city dominate, suggesting potential for deeper market penetration. The emphasis on lower-value but frequent transactions suggests a volume-driven model. Beverage sales can be further leveraged for higher gains. Ultimately, the insights help drive data-informed decisions for optimizing performance across sales channels.
